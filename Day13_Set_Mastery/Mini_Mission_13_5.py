Mini Mission 5 - Set Analyzer
üéØ Goal: Analyze a dataset using set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

üîß Mission Brief:
Two groups of students attended two different coding workshops. You're tasked with analyzing their attendance.

workshop_A = {"arka", "ria", "samit", "john", "nina"}
workshop_B = {"ria", "tara", "john", "dev", "meera"}

üõ†Ô∏è Your Tasks:
Write a program that does the following:

‚úÖ **Print all students who attended at least one workshop.
‚úÖ **Print students who attended both workshops.
‚úÖ **Print students who attended only **Workshop A.
‚úÖ **Print students who attended only **Workshop B.
