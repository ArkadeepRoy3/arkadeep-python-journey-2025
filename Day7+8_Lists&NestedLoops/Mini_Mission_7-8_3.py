ðŸ§ª Mini Mission 3: Matrix Printer
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Print elements of a 2D list (a list of lists) in a structured, grid-like format.

ðŸ“Œ Your Tasks:
âœ… Use a predefined 2D list (you can later make it user input if you want)
âœ… Loop through each row and then through each element
âœ… Print the matrix neatly as rows and columns
âœ… Bonus: Try using join() for more elegant printing (if you feel confident)
