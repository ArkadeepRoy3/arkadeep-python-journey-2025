ðŸ”¥ Warm-up Tasks

Zero Division Guard
Write a small function that divides two numbers but gracefully handles ZeroDivisionError and prints "Division by zero not allowed!".

File Reader with Fallback
Try to open a file "day20.txt".

If it exists, print its contents.

If it doesn't, catch the FileNotFoundError and instead print "File missing! Creating it...", then create the file with some starter text.

Safe Int Conversion
Take a list like ["10", "20", "hello", "30"].

Convert each element to an integer.

If conversion fails, catch the ValueError and skip that element.

Print the cleaned integer list.
