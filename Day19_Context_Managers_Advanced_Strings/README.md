# Day 19 – Context Managers & Advanced String Methods ✅

### What I Learned
- Using `with open()` as a **context manager** to handle files safely.  
- Practiced `.partition()` and `.rpartition()` to split strings from left vs right.  
- Checked filenames with `.startswith()` and `.endswith()`.  
- Used `.expandtabs()` to align text properly.  
- Combined methods (`partition + strip + join + expandtabs`) into one final exercise.  

### Mini Mission Completed
**Mixed String Lab** – A combined exercise where I:  
- Stripped extra spaces & expanded tabs  
- Checked prefix/suffix of filenames  
- Partitioned text from both left & right  
- Cleaned the text with `.split()` + `.join()`  

✅ Successfully solved and committed progress for **Day 19**.
