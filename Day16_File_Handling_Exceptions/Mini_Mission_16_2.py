üß© Mini Mission 2 - Clean Overwriter
üéØ Objective:
Clean up a .txt file by removing all empty or whitespace-only lines.

‚úÖ Specifications:

Prompt the user for a .txt filename
If the file does not exist, handle it gracefully using try-except

Remove all lines that are:

Completely empty ("")
Only whitespace (e.g., " ", "\t\n")
Overwrite the original file with the cleaned lines
Display how many lines were removed (e.g., 4 lines removed.)

Use:

with for file handling
.strip() to detect empty/whitespace-only lines
try-except for error handling

üí° Hints:

Read all lines using .readlines()
Use a list comprehension to filter out the lines
Use len() to calculate removed lines

üßæ sample.txt (before cleaning):

Hello, this is line one.

This is line three.

     
This is line five.
	
		
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Program Run (Terminal):

Enter the filename: sample.txt
4 lines removed.
File cleaned successfully.

üßæ sample.txt (after cleaning):

Hello, this is line one.
This is line three.
This is line five.
