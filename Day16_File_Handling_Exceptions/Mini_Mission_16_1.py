üß© Mini Mission 1 - Safe Logger
Objective: Create a robust file backup tool that reads a file, creates a backup, and logs success or failure ‚Äî using advanced file handling and exception structure.

‚úÖ Mission Requirements

Build a function backup_file() that:
Asks the user for a filename (must end with .txt)
Checks if the file exists
If not, prints: ‚ùå File not found. Backup failed.

If the file exists:

Creates a backup file named: backup_<original>.txt
Copies all content from the original into the backup
Logs the operation outcome using:
try...except...else...finally

üí° Hints

Use 'r' mode to read original
Use 'w' mode to write to backup

Backup filename can be built like:

backup_name = "backup_" + filename

üß† Skill Focus

File I/O confidence
Backup logic
Realistic exception control
