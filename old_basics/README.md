# 🗂️ Old Basics

This folder contains my earliest Python practice programs, written **before I started my structured Python Journey (Day 1 onward)**.  

These files represent raw exploration of syntax, loops, conditionals, and other beginner-level concepts.  
They are kept here as a record of my starting point, showing progress from first steps to structured learning.  

📌 Note: These scripts may not follow the same structure and organization as my journey files — they are snapshots of my early coding days.
