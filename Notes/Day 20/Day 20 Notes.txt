ðŸ““ Day 20 Notes â€” Error Handling + Context Managers

ðŸ”¹ Error Handling

Raising exceptions:

raise ValueError("Message")
raise TypeError("Message")


Custom exceptions:

class MyError(Exception):
    pass


Try/Except/Else/Finally:

try â†’ code that may fail.

except â†’ runs if error occurs.

else â†’ runs only if no error.

finally â†’ always runs (cleanup, logging, closing files).

ðŸ”¹ Context Managers (with)

Simplifies resource management â†’ ensures file/db/socket is closed even on error.

Multiple managers can be used at once:

with open("a.txt") as f1, open("b.txt") as f2:
    ...


Can nest with or use a loop to apply the same operation to multiple resources.

Exceptions inside context managers can be caught with nested try/except.
