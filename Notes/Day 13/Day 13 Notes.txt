📝 Day 13 Notes: Set Mastery

🔹 Creating Sets

my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
empty_set = set()
🔹 Adding and Removing

my_set.add("orange")
my_set.remove("banana")      # Errors if not found
my_set.discard("grape")      # Safe remove
🔹 Set Operations

a = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
b = {"banana", "cherry", "date"}

a & b        # Intersection
a | b        # Union
a - b        # Only in a
b - a        # Only in b
a ^ b        # In either but not both
🔹 Looping Over Sets

for item in my_set:
    print(item)
🔹 Real-World Use Cases
Removing duplicates from a list

Checking for common elements

Fast membership tests (in)

Comparing preferences, behaviors, events, etc.
