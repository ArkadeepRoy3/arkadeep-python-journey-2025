✅ 🔒 Day 16: Advanced File Handling + Exception Logic
🎯 Goals
Master file modes: r+, w+, a+, x

Understand file pointer control: seek(), tell()

Learn structured exception handling: try, except, else, finally

Practice real-world file I/O operations (read/write/update/backup)

Build confidence in safe, robust coding

📘 Concepts Covered
open() with advanced modes (r+, w+, a+, x)

File pointer control: seek(), tell(), .read(), .write()

Exception handling:

Basic try-except

else block (on success)

finally block (cleanup/logs)

Writing to files safely

Backups, cloning, and overwrites

Filename validation and error-proofing

🧪 Practice Tasks (All Completed)
Pointer Test: Read first 10 chars → reset pointer → read full file

Write vs Append: Observe overwrite vs append modes

Try + Else + Finally: Handle missing file gracefully

🔨 Mini Missions (Finalized)
ID	Title	Description
MM1	Backup Buddy	Ask for filename → create a backup with try/except/else/finally
MM2	Cleaner & Overwriter	Sanitize input file (remove punctuation, replace keywords), write to new file
MM3	Read or Write Detector	Open file in r+, w+, or a+ mode and show behavior of read/write

✔️ These are fully aligned with Day 15’s File CLI and lead directly into Day 17’s Modular Thinking + Error Debugging.

🏁 Outcome
After Day 16, you'll be able to:

Confidently open, modify, and save files with precise control

Handle common file I/O failures with grace

Write real-world file tools (logs, backups, sanitizers, readers)

Prepare for modular coding and exception tracing in bigger apps
