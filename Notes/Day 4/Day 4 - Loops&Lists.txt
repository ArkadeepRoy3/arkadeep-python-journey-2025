🧠 Pyro’s Notes – While Loop Refresher
✅ What is a while loop?
A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.

python
Copy
Edit
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
This will print 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (and then stop when count becomes 0)

⚠️ Important:
ALWAYS update the variable inside the loop, or it may run forever (infinite loop).
You can use break to exit a loop early.
Use continue to skip the rest of the loop for one iteration.


🧠 Pyro’s Notes - Before You Begin
Here’s a quick refresher (skip if you’re confident):

🔁 for loop + range():
python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
This will print numbers from 1 to 10 (because range is exclusive of the last number).



📚 Pyro’s Notes – Introduction to Lists in Python
In Python, a list is a container used to store multiple values in a single variable.

🛠️ Creating a List

marks = [85, 92, 78, 95]
names = ["Arka", "Ria", "Tara"]
A list can contain:

Integers
Strings
Even mixed types (but we usually keep it clean!)

📦 Accessing Elements (Indexing)

print(marks[0])   # 85 (1st element)
print(marks[2])   # 78 (3rd element)
✅ Index starts from 0 in Python.

🌀 Looping Through a List

for score in marks:
    print(score)

Or with index:

for i in range(len(marks)):
    print(marks[i])

🧰 Adding to a List

marks.append(88)  # Adds to end of the list

🧹 Modifying an Element

marks[1] = 90  # Changes 2nd score to 90

💣 Removing an Element

marks.remove(78)  # Removes value 78
del marks[0]      # Removes item at index 0

Mini Mission 12 – Number Splitter 🔢

🎯 Mission Goal:
You’ll take a number from the user as a string, split it into individual digits, convert each to int, and store them in a list.

🔍 Pyro’s Notes – Key Concepts

🧵 1. String is like a sequence
You can loop through each character in a string just like a list:

for char in "5271":
    print(char)  # prints 5, 2, 7, 1 (as strings)
🔁 2. Type conversion
Each digit will be a string, so you’ll need to convert:

digit = int(char)

📥 3. Building the digit list
Initialize an empty list and append the converted digits to it.

🧪 Example:
If user enters 7235, your code should generate:

📦 Digit List: [7, 2, 3, 5]
