ðŸ§¾ Day 10 Notes Recap â€“ Tuples & Immutable Sequences
Core Concepts Covered:

Tuples: Immutable ordered sequences

Tuple creation: (), tuple(), single-element tuples: (x,)

Tuple indexing, slicing

Tuple membership checks: x in my_tuple

Tuple concatenation: tuple1 + tuple2

Iteration: for x in my_tuple

Tuple conversion: list() and tuple() for mutability swap

Nesting & unpacking

Pythonic operations: slicing, .index(), .count(), zip()
