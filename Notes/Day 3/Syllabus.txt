🧠 Day 3 – Mastering Operators, Math, and More Logic!
Focus Areas: Arithmetic operators, math module, conditionals, compound logic, practical decision-making, and real-world applications.

📘 Day 3 Syllabus (Curated by Pyro)
✅ Arithmetic Operators Refresher

✅ Using math Module – (import, sqrt, pow, floor, ceil, etc.)

✅ Modulo (%) and Floor Division (//)

✅ Logical Operators Recap (and, or, not)

✅ Nested if-else and Compound Logic

✅ Chained Comparisons (e.g., 20 <= x <= 40)

✅ More on Input Validation

✅ Real-Life Logical Problems with AI-like Flow

✅ Mini Projects (if time permits)
