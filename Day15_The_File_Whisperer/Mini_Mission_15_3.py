ðŸ“„ Mini Mission 3: Keyword Finder
ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Ask the user for a keyword and a filename.
Then, read the file line-by-line and print only those lines that contain the keyword (case-insensitive).

ðŸ§ª Sample Flow:

Enter filename: diary.txt  
Enter keyword to search: dream

Matching lines:
Today I had a strange dream.
My dreams often feel real.
âœ… Requirements:

Case-insensitive search
Ignore leading/trailing whitespace
Only print lines where the keyword exists
